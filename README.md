# ðŸš€ **Bank Lending Analysis: Monitoring Portfolio Health and Strategic Trends ðŸ“Š**
_For my first project, I chose to focus on the finance domain, leveraging both my Business Analytics and Finance concentrations. The goal is to analyze a bank's loan portfolio and optimize lending strategies. Using **SQLite**, I will extract and manipulate loan data to calculate key financial metrics, while applying my finance knowledge to ensure accuracy. **Tableau**  will be used to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify trends across different loan terms. The project aims to assess risk exposure, recognize lending patterns, and guide data-driven decisions for improving loan strategies. Throughout the process, I will monitor the progress by refining visualizations and adjusting data as needed. By the end, the analysis will help forecast future trends, improve loan quality, and contribute to the overall financial health of the bank._ 

_Moreover, I build a model with the goal is to predict the probability of a loan being charged off (i.e., defaulting) by analyzing various factors. The rationale behind this model is to assess the likelihood of default based on financial health indicators (such as DTI and income) and loan terms, which will help identify high-risk loans early. For model interpretation, techniques such as SHAP values or LIME can be used to explain the decisions made by the model, providing insight into why a loan may be charged off._

### Installation and Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the Business Analytics project using **SQLite** and **Tableau**.
### 1. Clone the repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/hanh-analytics/Bank-loan-analysis
cd Bank-loan-analysis
```

### 2. Set up the SQLite database:
Since this project uses **SQLite**, no server installation is required. SQLite is a file-based database. To set it up:
1. Install an SQLite tool (e.g., **DB Browser for SQLite**) or use the command line interface.
    
2. If the database doesn't already exist, create it by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    sqlite3 Bank_loan_report.db
    ```

3. Inside the SQLite prompt, create the necessary table:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE "bank_loan" (
	"id"	INTEGER,
	"address_state"	VARCHAR(50),
	"application_type"	VARCHAR(50),
	"emp_length"	VARCHAR(50),
	"emp_title"	VARCHAR(100),
	"grade"	VARCHAR(50),
	"home_ownership"	VARCHAR(50),
	"issue_date"	date,
	"last_credit_pull_date"	date,
	"last_payment_date"	date,
	"loan_status"	varchar(50),
	"next_payment_date"	date,
	"member_id"	INT,
	"purpose"	VARCHAR(50),
	"sub_grade"	VARCHAR(50),
	"term"	VARCHAR(50),
	"verification_status"	VARCHAR(50),
	"annual_income"	REAL,
	"dti"	real,
	"installment"	real,
	"int_rate"	real,
	"loan_amount"	int,
	"total_acc"	int,
	"total_payment"	int,
	PRIMARY KEY("id" AUTOINCREMENT))


### 3. Load Data into SQLite

Since the dataset is provided as an Excel file, we need to convert it into a **CSV** file first. After converting, import the CSV data into the SQLite database.

To import the data, follow these steps:

1. Launch the SQLite command line or **DB Browser for SQLite**.
2. Import the CSV into the SQLite database with the following command:
    
    ```bash
    .mode csv
    .import financial_loan.csv  bank_loan
    ```

This will load the data from your CSV file into the `bank_loan` table.
### 4. Create and Run SQL Queries

After loading the data, you can run SQL queries to analyze the data. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(id) AS Total_Loan_Applications
FROM bank_loan
```
### 5. Run Tableau Visualizations

To visualize the data in **Tableau**:

1. Open **Tableau Desktop**.
2. In Tableau, connect to the **SQLite database** by selecting `SQLite` as the connection type.
3. Choose the `Bank_loan_report.db` file you created earlier.
4. Load the `bank_loan` table and begin building your visualizations.

If you have an existing `.twb` (Tableau Workbook) file, you can open it directly:

```bash
open visualizations/bank_loan_report.twb
```

### 6. Additional Notes

- Since SQLite is a file-based database, ensure that the `Bank_loan_report.db` file is in the correct location relative to your project files.
- If you need to modify the database connection in Tableau, make sure Tableau is pointed to the correct `.db` file.
- If you encounter any issues with data import or queries, refer to the `scripts/queries` folder for common SQL queries or troubleshooting tips.

## Usage Instructions for Tableau Dashboard

Once you have set up the project and loaded the data into SQLite, follow these steps to begin using the project:

### 1. Open SQLite Database
To interact with the data, you will need to open the SQLite database. You can use tools like **DB Browser for SQLite** or any SQLite-compatible client. 

To open the database using the command line:
```bash
sqlite3 Bank_loan_report.db
```

### 2. Run SQL Queries: 
You can use SQL queries to analyze the data. Here's an example of how to calculate Bad Loan Percentage:
```bash
SELECT 
 (COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = â€˜Charge Offâ€™ THEN id END) *100)/ COUNT(id) AS Bad_Loan_Applications_Percentage 
FROM bank_loan
```

### 3. Visualize Data in Tableau:
1. Open **Tableau Desktop**.
2. In Tableau, connect to the **SQLite database** by selecting `SQLite` as the connection type.
3. Choose the `Bank_loan_report.db` file you created earlier.
4. Load the `bank_loan` table and begin building your visualizations.

If you have an existing `.twb` (Tableau Workbook) file, you can open it directly:

```bash
open https://github.com/hanh-analytics/Bank-loan-analysis/blob/947d3b3125ec9fde51bb4d36ff32b96e3fe886d4/visualization/Bank_Loan_Report.twbx
```


## Installation and Setup Instructions for Building the Loan Default Prediction Model

To build and run the **Loan Default Prediction Model**, follow the steps below to set up your environment and install the required dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanh-analytics/Bank-loan-analysis
cd Bank-loan-analysis
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated. You can do this by running:
```bash
# For Linux/macOS:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# For Windows:
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries
To install all the necessary Python libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn shap lime matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### 4. Set Up Jupyter Notebook
If you havenâ€™t installed Jupyter Notebook yet, you can do so by running:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can launch a notebook by running:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open a new tab in your browser where you can begin working on your notebooks.

### 5. Load the Dataset into SQLite
Before running the model, make sure your dataset is available in the **SQLite database** (`Bank_loan_report.db`). If it's not already loaded, follow these steps:
1. Install SQLite tools (e.g., **DB Browser for SQLite**) if not already installed.
2. Import the **CSV file** into the **SQLite database** using the command:
   ```bash
   .mode csv
   .import financial_loan.csv  bank_loan
   ```

### 6. Run the Model
1. Open the **Jupyter Notebook** where the model is implemented (for example, `loan_default_model.ipynb`).
2. Follow the steps in the notebook:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, encode, and scale the data.
   - **Model Training**: Train the machine learning model using **RandomForestClassifier** (or any other model of choice).
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using classification metrics (e.g., F1-score, accuracy).
   - **Model Interpretation**: Use **SHAP** or **LIME** for interpreting model predictions.

### 7. Run the Model Interpretation (SHAP or LIME)
To explain the predictions of your model, you can use SHAP or LIME:
- Install SHAP:
  ```bash
  pip install shap
  ```
- Or install LIME:
  ```bash
  pip install lime
  ```
Use these libraries as explained in the notebook to generate plots and gain insights into which features influence the loan default prediction.

### 8. Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and the paths to your data files are correct.
- Check the `notebooks` folder for any utility functions that may help in data processing or model evaluation.
