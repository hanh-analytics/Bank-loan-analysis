## How to View the Visualizations

2. **Interactive Visualizations**: If you are working with Tableau or want to interact with these visualizations, please download the full **Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx)** file from the main project repository.

## Insights and Usage

- **Trend Over Time**: This chart shows the sales trend over a specified period, allowing you to identify growth patterns, seasonality, and other trends.
- **Sales Distribution**: The pie chart breaks down the sales by different categories (e.g., product type or region), which can help you understand which categories are performing the best.
