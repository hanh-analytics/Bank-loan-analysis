# **Images Folder**

The `images/` folder contains visualizations generated during the analysis. These visualizations provide insights into the model's behavior and explain individual predictions. Key contents include:

- **Feature Importance Plots**:  
  - Global feature importance visualizations that show the most influential features in determining the model's predictions.
  
- **LIME Explanations**:  
  - Local bar plots created using LIME to explain the impact of features for individual predictions, specifically focusing on instances of loans marked as "charged off."

These visualizations are essential for understanding how the model evaluates features and makes decisions, offering interpretability for both global trends and individual predictions.
