# Detailed Insights üîç 
_This file tends to investigate deeper into insights I mentioned in [Execute Summary](insights/Executive_Summary.md). This report's goal is to examine the bank's loan portfolio with an emphasis on a number of important financial indicators, including debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, interest rates, loan amounts, and loan status. The objectives of this research are to evaluate possible risks, shed light on the portfolio's health, and make suggestions for better lending practices._

In this report, we will examine:

 - **Bank health**: Key indicators such as the Total Amount Received, Total Funded Amount and DTI ratio provide insight into the bank's profitability and risk exposure.
   
 - **Portfolio perfomance**: There is still a considerable chance of a _higher default risk_ even though the presence of Good Loan status and comparatively low average DTI ratios for both low-risk and high-risk categories indicate solid portfolio performance.
   
 - **Higher risk of defaults**: By examining interest rates and purposes, we can determine the high needs of clients and then recommend an appropriate method of risk mitigation.

## 1. Data Overview:

- **Grade**: The grade is used by banks to control risk and set loan prices. Higher-grade loans are more appealing to investors and usually have lower interest rates.
  
- **Loan Status**: The purpose of Loan Status is to show the loan's current status (e.g., fully paid, current, default). Banks utilize Loan Status to classify loans for risk analysis, track loan health, and identify provisioning needs.
  
- **Purpose**: By segmenting and tailoring loan offerings, banks may match lending terms to the demands of their borrowers.
  
- **Verification Status**: Verification Status shows if the borrower's financial data has been validated. Banks utilize this field to assess the trustworthiness of loan applications, confirm income, and measure data reliability.

- **DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)**: DTI determines how much debt the borrower can afford to take on. DTI is used by banks to evaluate a borrower's capacity to manage loan payments and make smart lending choices.
  
- **Loan Amount**: The loan amount¬†shows the amount of the principle.¬†Banks calculate loan sizes based on loan amounts. In this case, the total loan amount is _Total Funded Amount_. 
  
- **Loan Applications**: When people or companies apply for loans, they fill out comprehensive forms that contain financial and personal data. This information is gathered either on paper or electronically.
  
- **Amount Received**: The amount of money that clients repay for their loans to the bank.
