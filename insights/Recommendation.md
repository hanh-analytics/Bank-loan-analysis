# Recommendation
_This file generally offers an overview of the bank's lending operations, portfolio performance, and present state of health before outlining the solutions, comprehensive short- and long-term goals, and anticipated results_. 

## 1. Executive Summary

- **Loan Diversification**: Reduce reliance on high-risk loan categories like credit card loans and debt consolidation by promoting the expansion of other loan kinds (such as mortgages and small business loans) to diversify the loan portfolio. Long-term advantages will result from this strategy.
  
- **Risk-based Pricing**: Adjust interest rates based on the risk level of the borrowers. Offer attractive rates to low-risk borrowers while raising rates for higher-risk borrowers to compensate for potential losses. This works as a temporary fix really well.

- **Credit Risk Assessment**:
  - **Improve Credit Scoring Models**: Use machine learning and advanced analytics to improve credit scoring systems and guarantee more accurate risk assessments.
 
  - **Reassess Lending Policies**: Boost underwriting standards, especially for high-risk loan types like _credit cards_ and _debt consolidation_.
 
  


## 2. Analysis Overview

  The bank is at high risk of default even if it has good indications like low debt-to-income ratios (DTI), strong liquidity, and positive loan status metrics that show good bank health and portfolio performance. This risk results from continuously high interest rates (over 10%) for all loan purposes as well as a significant percentage of all loan applications falling into high-risk categories like credit card and debt consolidation loans. The stability of the portfolio may be threatened by this imbalance, which could result in higher borrower distress and default possibilities.

**Broaden loan grade offerings**:
  - Currently, a significant portion of the bankâ€™s loans is concentrated in Grades B with a slightly lower proportion of A and C. While these grades provide substantial returns, they also expose the bank to increased default risk. Borrowers in Grade B typically have moderate creditworthiness. While they are not as risky as Grade C borrowers, they are not as reliable as Grade A borrowers.
    
  - A large volume of loans in Grade B means the bank is exposed to the default behavior of borrowers with similar risk profiles. If economic conditions worsen, this group could collectively face repayment challenges, amplifying losses. Grade A loans are considered the least risky and contribute to portfolio stability. A lower proportion of these loans reduces the bank's buffer against losses from riskier grades.
    
  - To reduce concentration risk, the bank should consider expanding its loan offerings to include more loans in Grades A and D, which can provide more stability and spread risk across different borrower profiles.

**Adjust interest rates based on borrower risk**: 
  - The bank should consider implementing a more granular, risk-based pricing strategy. This involves offering different interest rates based on a borrower's credit grade, DTI ratio, and historical repayment behavior. For example, lower-risk borrowers should receive more competitive rates to attract high-quality customers. Conversely, higher-risk borrowers (e.g., those in Grades D, E, F, G, or with high DTIs) should be charged a premium interest rate to account for the increased likelihood of default.
    
  - Although grades D, E, F, and G can increase revenue, the bank should carefully use advanced analytics and predictive modeling to assess default probabilities more accurately. In addition, it needs to implement stricter credit scoring criteria within Grades D to F with regular evaluation to identify the least risky borrowers within these grades.

**Enhanced Credit Risk Assessment**

  ![Total Applications by Purpose](https://github.com/hanh-analytics/Bank-loan-analysis/blob/a162589c4d41869d49e018576b5a838be60c04b6/visualization/Total_Application_by_Purpose.jpg)
  
  - *The loan purpose review* is an essential component of credit risk assessment. Through an analysis of the primary goals of loans, such as `credit card` and `debt consolidation`, the bank can spot possible hazards. Since these loans show that borrowers are utilizing credit to manage their current debt, which may be a symptom of underlying financial instability, they are frequently linked to financial trouble. It's possible that neither the borrower nor the bank would benefit financially in the long run.
    
  - The bank should think about providing *flexible repayment options* to help borrowers better manage their responsibilities and reduce the likelihood of defaults. In addition, the bank might diversify its loan portfolio by emphasizing credit segments that provide long-term financial stability for both the borrower and the bank, including `educational` or `home improvement`, in order to lessen its reliance on high-risk loan categories.

   **Concentration Risk (Loan Portfolio Distribution)**: 
  
    - **Description**: Indicates how much of the bank's loan portfolio is focused on a specific industry, loan type, or borrower segment.

    - **Impact**: High concentration in one area (credit cards, debt consolidation, etc.) raises the default risk, particularly during recessions or when particular industries face difficulties.

    - **Goal**: Lessen exposure to sector-specific risks, the loan portfolio should ideally be well-diversified across various loan types, borrower categories, and sectors.

    **Non-Performing Loan (NPL) Ratio by Loan Type**:
   
    - **Description**: Calculates the proportion of loans that are in default, broken down by borrower or loan type.
  
    - **Impact**: Higher non-performing loan (NPL) ratios in a certain loan type or industry are indicative of greater risk and may indicate a lack of or inefficiency in diversification in that field.
