# Recommendation
_This file generally offers an overview of the bank's lending operations, portfolio performance, and present state of health before outlining the solutions, comprehensive short- and long-term goals, and anticipated results_. 

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Risk-based Pricing**: Adjust interest rates based on the risk level of the borrowers. Offer attractive rates to low-risk borrowers while raising rates for higher-risk borrowers to compensate for potential losses. This works as a temporary fix really well.

- **Credit Risk Assessment**:
  - **Improve Credit Scoring Models**: Use machine learning and advanced analytics to improve credit scoring systems and guarantee more accurate risk assessments.
 
  - **Reassess Lending Policies**: Boost underwriting standards, especially for high-risk loan types like _credit cards_ and _debt consolidation_.
 
- **Loan Diversification**: Reduce reliance on high-risk loan categories like credit card loans and debt consolidation by promoting the expansion of other loan kinds (such as mortgages and small business loans) to diversify the loan portfolio. Long-term advantages will result from this strategy.   


## 2. Analysis Overview

  The bank is at high risk of default even if it has good indications like low debt-to-income ratios (DTI), strong liquidity, and positive loan status metrics that show good bank health and portfolio performance. This risk results from continuously high interest rates (over 10%) for all loan purposes as well as a significant percentage of all loan applications falling into high-risk categories like credit card and debt consolidation loans. The stability of the portfolio may be threatened by this imbalance, which could result in higher borrower distress and default possibilities.
