# Recommendation
_This file generally offers an overview of the bank's lending operations, portfolio performance, and present state of health before outlining the solutions, comprehensive short- and long-term goals, and anticipated results_. 

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Risk-based Pricing**: Adjust interest rates based on the risk level of the borrowers. Offer attractive rates to low-risk borrowers while raising rates for higher-risk borrowers to compensate for potential losses. This works as a temporary fix really well.

- **Credit Risk Assessment**:
  - **Improve Credit Scoring Models**: Use machine learning and advanced analytics to improve credit scoring systems and guarantee more accurate risk assessments.
 
  - **Reassess Lending Policies**: Boost underwriting standards, especially for high-risk loan types like _credit cards_ and _debt consolidation_.
 
- **Loan Diversification**: Reduce reliance on high-risk loan categories like credit card loans and debt consolidation by promoting the expansion of other loan kinds (such as mortgages and small business loans) to diversify the loan portfolio. Long-term advantages will result from this strategy.   


## 2. Analysis Overview

  The bank is at high risk of default even if it has good indications like low debt-to-income ratios (DTI), strong liquidity, and positive loan status metrics that show good bank health and portfolio performance. This risk results from continuously high interest rates (over 10%) for all loan purposes as well as a significant percentage of all loan applications falling into high-risk categories like credit card and debt consolidation loans. The stability of the portfolio may be threatened by this imbalance, which could result in higher borrower distress and default possibilities.

## 3. Recommended Actions

**Broaden loan grade offerings**:
  - Currently, a significant portion of the bankâ€™s loans is concentrated in Grades B with a slightly lower proportion of A and C. While these grades provide substantial returns, they also expose the bank to increased default risk. Borrowers in Grade B typically have moderate creditworthiness. While they are not as risky as Grade C borrowers, they are not as reliable as Grade A borrowers.
  - A large volume of loans in Grade B means the bank is exposed to the default behavior of borrowers with similar risk profiles. If economic conditions worsen, this group could collectively face repayment challenges, amplifying losses. Grade A loans are considered the least risky and contribute to portfolio stability. A lower proportion of these loans reduces the bank's buffer against losses from riskier grades.
  - To reduce concentration risk, the bank should consider expanding its loan offerings to include more loans in Grades A and D, which can provide more stability and spread risk across different borrower profiles.


## 4. Implementation Plan
Timeline: Define short-term, medium-term, and long-term actions.
Resources Needed: Specify personnel, technology, or financial resources required for implementation.
Accountability: Assign responsibilities to teams or individuals for each action.

Performance Metrics: Define how success will be measured, e.g., default rate reduction, liquidity ratio improvement, or loan repayment rates.
Timeline for Results: Set realistic expectations for when outcomes will be visible.

## 6. Conclusion
Reiterate the importance of the recommended actions.
Emphasize the potential benefits, such as improved financial stability and investor confidence
