# Executive Summary ðŸ“Š
_This report analyzes the performance of a bank's loan portfolio, focusing on borrower trends, repayment behaviors, and key financial metrics to assess portfolio health and optimize lending operations. The insights were derived from an extensive dataset containing loan applications, funded amounts, amount received, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI)_
## Key Findings
- **Stable Bank health**
  
    - **Liquidity**: Strong payback performance across the loan portfolio is indicated by the bank's steady liquidity position, which is demonstrated by a constant ratio of **total amount received** to **total funded amount**. This guarantees sufficient cash flow to fulfill financial and operational commitments.
      
    - **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: With an average DTI (13%) that is well within industry standards (below 36%, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)), borrowers show reasonable financial difficulties. This implies that the clients in the bank's portfolio are able to make loan payments, lowering the risk of default and enhancing portfolio stability overall.
      
- **Good Portfolio performance**
  - **Good Loan status**: The proportion of loans with a verification status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current' (92.1%) is significantly higher than the proportion of 'Charged Off' loans (7.9%) when measured by the total amount received.
    
  - **Average DTI by Grade**: The average DTI for both low-risk and high-risk are relatively low, 13.1% and 14.1%.
    
- _**Higher Risk of Default**_
  
  - **Interest rate**: The interest rate for every loan purpose is higher than 10% could indicate that the bank is targeting a higher-risk borrower segment, which is more likely to default.
    
  - **Total Loan application by Purpose**: The majority of loan applications are for debt consolidation and credit card purposes, typically involving borrowers who may already be struggling with existing debt. The perceived risk of these loans often results in higher interest rates, but higher rates often burden borrowers, making it more difficult for them to repay, which may increase the likelihood of default.
    
## Solution:

- **Marketing**: Increase marketing activity aimed at Grade A,B, and C debtors to improve the dependability of payments.
  
- **Loan Diversification**: Broaden loan grade offerings to include more loans in Grade D, E, F, and G. While grade D, E, F and G means _riskier_ loans, the bank may think about diversifying into Grades D, E, F, and G to maximize returns, but it should proceed cautiously and under supervision.

- **Risk-Adjusted Pricing Strategy**: Charge borrowers with high DTI with premium interest rate and lower-risk borrowers should receive more competitive rates to attract high-quality customers.
